    <h1 style="text-align: center;">My Thoughts on <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> Chapter 1</h1>
    <p>This chapter did a good job discussing something that I&apos;ve long thought of; <em>the programmer mindset</em>. This way of thinking involves how we solve problems. Programming takes a certain mindset, especially when things go wrong - and they will. Its the ability to really break down you code and to exhaust all your resources before throwing in the towel. Issues pop up all the time in software development. Just look at CD Projekt Red&apos;s recent release of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. The project was delayed multiple times - to great public backlash - due to massive bugs and game-breaking glitches. But as chapter 1 recommends, they took the responsibility for their code and kept working on it as a pragmatic programmer should.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I also enjoyed how the author discussed <em>learning from opportunity</em>. If someone asks you a question that you don&apos;t know the answer to, it&apos;s probably a good idea to educate yourself on the topic. Because it is more than likely that you will receive that question (or have that question yourself) again.&nbsp;</p>
