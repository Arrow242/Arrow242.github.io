    <h1 style="text-align: center;">My Thoughts on <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> Chapter 2</h1>
    <p>When working on smaller projects, making things easier to change (ETC) never really crosses my mind. But I see why it is be a good habit. Especially on larger projects, keeping things ETC is a must. Inevitability, there will be revisions or bugs that need to be resolved and if the code cannot be easily manipulated, it could lead to a lot of wasted time. There are various ways that code can become ETC. For instance, making the code easier to read and documenting changes can help significantly, specially if someone else will be editing the code down the line. Also naming variables things that make sense, instead of abstract letters or acronyms can prevent someone from having to dig through the lines of code to figure out what that variable is actually used for.</p>
    <p>If you&apos;re testing out something completely new in code, its a good idea to get a feeling for its feasibility before fully implementing it only to realize it doesn&apos;t function the way it was indended to. This is where &quot;tracer bullets&quot; come in handy. Though it sounds cooler than it actually is, making use of tracer bullets in code can actually be very important when a project has many factors. Essentially, tracer bullets are making the skeleton of the final project, encompassing all the major components without any extra features, just to make sure it works. This concept reminds me of the term &quot;vertical slice&quot; which is essentially a demo project utilizing components from the front end, back end, and database.</p>
